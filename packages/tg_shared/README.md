# tg-shared

Shared Telegram core for two projects ([epic #1416](https://github.com/axisrow/tg_content_factory/issues/1416)):

- **tg-agent** (this repository) — the content factory;
- **tg_messenger** — the standalone single-account TUI messenger.

**Status: scaffold only** (stage 1.1, #1420). No factory code has moved yet —
module migration happens in wave A (#1421, zero-coupling modules) and wave B
(#1422, the flood-protection layer).

The package must work **without the factory at all**: one account, its own
storage, no `AppContainer`.

## Boundary — what lives where

| Capability | Home | Why |
|---|---|---|
| connection, sessions | **this package** | needed by both |
| message models, history reading, sending | **this package** | needed by both |
| flood protection (`flood_wait`, `flood_breaker`, `rate_limit_gate`, `rate_limiter`, `mtproto_watchdog`) | **this package** (wave B) | needed by both |
| incoming-event subscription plumbing | **this package** (stage 2) | needed by both |
| multi-account pool, rotation, leasing (`client_pool`, `pool_lifecycle`, `pool_dialogs`, `account_lease_pool`, `pool_flood`) | **factory** | a single-account messenger needs none of it |
| post collection (`collector_*`) | **factory** | factory's domain logic |
| TUI, web chat, auto-responder | **messenger** | its product |

### `backends.py` split (defined here, executed in the waves)

`tg_agent/telegram/backends.py` splits along its two halves:

- **To the package (transport):** `TelegramTransportSession` — the whole
  send/read/resolve/media/event-handler surface (lines ≈196–981), plus the
  dialog-request gate and flood-context translation it carries. It operates on
  a client the *caller* provides; it knows nothing about pools.
- **Stays in the factory (acquisition):** `TelegramBackend` ABC,
  `NativeTelethonBackend`, `TelethonCliBackend`, `BackendClientLease`,
  `BackendRouter` (≈983–1183). Choosing and leasing a client per account is
  pool-specific; the messenger passes its single client directly.

## Storage contract

The formalization of `tg_agent/database/live_accounts.py`: the shared layer
needs exactly **three things** from storage — account data, `flood_wait_until`
write, and a string key-value for flood-layer persistence (resolve-backoff
payload, consumed in wave B). No factory schema leaks.

```python
from tg_shared import JsonFileStore, SharedAccount, SharedAccountStore

store: SharedAccountStore = JsonFileStore("messenger.json")   # single messenger
store: SharedAccountStore = factory_db                        # runtime conformance; static at #1424
```

Method names mirror the factory facade's existing methods
(`get_accounts` / `update_account_flood` / `get_setting` / `set_setting`), so
the factory `Database` satisfies the Protocol at **runtime** — the
`isinstance` check in the scaffold tests passes, no adapter needed. Static
conformance is deliberately not claimed yet: `Database.get_accounts()`
returns `list[Account]` and `list` is invariant, so a type checker rejects it
as `list[SharedAccount]`. At #1424 the factory closes that gap (returns
`SharedAccount` or adapts through a typed wrapper); until then the factory
line in the snippet is illustrative, not statically checked. The package
never imports factory models (guarded by `tests/test_tg_shared_scaffold.py`).

## Versioning and pinning

- SemVer; version lives in `pyproject.toml` + `CHANGELOG.md` entry per change.
- **Every consumer pins exact versions** (`tg-shared==0.1.0`). Precedent not to
  repeat: `tg-messenger` was declared `>=0.1.0` with no tags and no changelog,
  leaving the factory on an untracked editable checkout.
- Tags (`v0.1.0` …) start once the package has its own repository (below).

## Repository split

While the package lives in this monorepo (`packages/tg_shared/`), the factory
suite imports it via a `sys.path` shim in the scaffold test; CI covers it with
zero workflow changes. Creating the standalone GitHub repository is an owner
decision (external publishing). When it happens:

1. `git subtree split -P packages/tg_shared -b tg-shared-split` → push to the
   new repository; tag `v0.1.0`.
2. Move `tests/test_tg_shared_scaffold.py` (package-owned half) into the new
   repository's test tree; keep the factory-side conformance test here.
3. Factory/messenger switch their dependencies to the exact pin (#1424/#1425).

## Migration strategy (waves, epic #1416)

1. **1.1 #1420 (this scaffold)** — package, Protocol, boundary; nothing moves.
2. **1.2 #1421 wave A** — zero-coupling modules (`auth`, `session_materializer`,
   `botfather`, `identity`, `media`) move into the package; the factory imports
   them from the package. Behavior unchanged, tests move with the modules.
3. **1.3 #1422 wave B** — flood-protection layer moves; its DB touchpoints go
   through `SharedAccountStore` (settings kv for resolve-backoff persistence).
4. **1.5 #1424** — the factory declares the exact-pin dependency and drops the
   monorepo shim.
5. **1.6 #1425** — the messenger switches to the package; its vendored flood
   fork is deleted.

Intermediate states stay green because each wave flips the factory's imports
in the same commit as the module move — no copy-then-switch window.
